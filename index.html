					<p>The middle of winter has long been a time of celebration around the world. Centuries before the arrival of the man called Jesus, early Europeans celebrated light and birth in the darkest days of winter. Many peoples rejoiced during the winter solstice, when the worst of the winter was behind them and they could look forward to longer days and extended hours of sunlight.</p>

					<p>In Scandinavia, the Norse celebrated Yule from December 21, the winter solstice, through January. In recognition of the return of the sun, fathers and sons would bring home large logs, which they would set on fire. The people would feast until the log burned out, which could take as many as 12 days. The Norse believed that each spark from the fire represented a new pig or calf that would be born during the coming year.</p>

			<p> Since the early 20th century, many modern traditions have formed for Christmas. Christmas trees were popularized by European settlers in the early 19th century. Now more than 80% of Americans are reported to have Christmas trees on their homes, over half of them being artificial. </p> 
			<p> From 2005 to the present, many parents have been hiding stuffed elves around their homes from Thanksgiving to Christmas. Over 13 million elves have been purchased along with the corresponding book,<i> "Elf on the Shelf:A Christmas Tradition"</i>. Many are seen in the midst of elaborate situations, such as TP'ing the tree. </p>
