			<tr>
				<th>Ingredients Needed</th>
				<th>Steps</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter slightly softened to room temperature, 3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar, large bowl, handheld or stand mixer</td>
				<td> Step 1. In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter until creamed and smooth for about 1 minute. Add the sugar and beat on high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 or 4 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>mixture from Step 1, 1 large egg, 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon almond extract</td>
				<td>Step 2. Add the egg, vanilla, and almond extract and beat on high until fully combine, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2 and 1/4 cups (281g) all-purpose flour (spoon and leveled), 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt</td>
				<td>Step 3. Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Turn the mixer down to low and add about half of the flour mixture to the previous mixture, beating until just barely combined. Add the rest of the flour and continue mixing until just combined. If the dough still seems too soft, you can add 1 Tablespoon more flour until it is a better consistency for rolling.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> parchment paper, baking sheet, cookie dough</td>
				<td> Step 4. Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Roll each portion out onto a piece of parchment to about 1/4 inch thickness. Stack the pieces (with paper) onto a baking sheet, cover lightly, and refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days. Chilling is mandatory.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> parchment paper, baking sheet, cookie dough, cookie cutter</td>
				<td> Step 5. Once chilled, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. The amount of batches will depend on how large/small you cut your cookies. Remove one of the dough pieces from the refrigerator and using a cookie cutter, cut in shapes. Transfer the cut cookie dough to the prepared baking sheet. Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until very lightly colored on top and around the edges. Make sure you rotate the baking sheet halfway through bake time. Allow to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before icing. No need to cover the cookies as the cookies cool.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>1 and 1/2 cups (180g) confectioners sugar, 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon light corn syrup, 2 to 2.5 Tablespoons (30-38ml) room temperature water, pinch salt</td>
				<td> Step 6. For the icing, whisk the confectioners sugar, vanilla, corn syrup, and 2 tablespoons of water in a medium bowl. It should be quite thick. If it is much too thick, add 1/2 Tablespoon more water. If it is much too thin, add 2 more Tablespoons of confectioners sugar. If you drizzle a little of the icing with the whisk, the ribbon of icing will hold for a few seconds before melting back into the icing. That is when you know it is the right consistency and is ready to use. If desired, add liquid or gel food coloring. You can pour some icing into different bowls if using multiple colors. If not decorating right away, cover the icing tightly and keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Decorate the cooled cookies however you would like. </td>
